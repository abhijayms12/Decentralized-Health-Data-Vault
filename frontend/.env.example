# Notes:
# - Mock IPFS fallback: If Lighthouse fails, files are stored in browser sessionStorage
# - WARNING: sessionStorage is cleared when browser closes - files are NOT persistent
# - For persistent storage, implement Express backend to proxy Lighthouse/Pinata uploads
# - See: QUICKSTART.md for Express backend setup instructions
